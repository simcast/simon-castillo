                    <p>In Accurx, workspaces are where healthcare professionals communicate and collaborate with each other on patient care. My team was responsible for launching this key functionality.</p>
                    <p>I brought clarity to the product vision and designed the key pieces needed for workspaces to function. I also worked on the practical aspects of the launch, to minimise disruption and maximise uptake.</p>

                <p>When I first joined, a common question around the business was: ‘What exactly is a workspace?’. This was going to be a fundamental part of Accurx's offering. So to ensure we were all moving towards the same goal, I worked with stakeholders to answer that question and build a clearer picture to share across teams.

                <p>The main task seemed simple: translate legislation into programmable rules for calculating disclosure dates for different types of caution and conviction.
                </p>
                <p>
                We quickly found that the rules were not so straightforward. So over a series of meetings, the product manager and I worked with legal teams across departments to define the law - and all of its nuances and exceptions - as clearly as possible.

                <p>While understanding the law, I also built our understanding of users to make sure we were meeting their needs. I coded prototypes which we tested with youth offender management teams and adults with past convictions. We also asked generally about their experiences for more context.
                </p>
                <p>These interviews uncovered more user needs beyond the project's scope, which led to wider improvements on the GOV.UK content.</p>

I left the project shortly after the public release, however initial feedback was consistently positive. Past offenders and charities who work with them praised the tool's usability, clarity and reliability. Below are some example screens from the tool.

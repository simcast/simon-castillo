                        <p>In Accurx, workspaces are where NHS healthcare professionals communicate with each other about patient care. My team was responsible for launching this key functionality and moving all users into workspaces.</p>
                        <p>I helped to clarify the product vision and, in collaboration with multiple teams, designed flows for workspace creation, onboarding, access management and configuration.

                    <p>"What exactly is a workspace?" was the key question being asked around the business when I joined the team. As it was going to be a fundamental part of Accurx's offering, I started by building a clearer picture.

                    <p>Once aligned on the vision, I worked on the practical design pieces needed. For example, allowing users to create workspaces, add people to them and self-manage them through different roles and permissions.</p>
                    <p>Over several months, I continuously worked with user reseachers, developers, product and other stakeholders to add each piece.</p>

                        As a result, we were able to successfully transfer key cohorts into workspaces and built a playbook of tactics to transfer all users.

                    <p>In Accurx, workspaces are where healthcare professionals communicate with each other about patient care. My team was responsible for launching this key functionality.</p>
                    <p>I brought clarity to the product vision and, in collaboration with multiple teams, designed all of the UI pieces needed to make it a reality. I also worked on the practical aspects of the launch to minimise disruption and maximise uptake.</p>

                <p>When I first joined, a common question around the business was: ‘What exactly is a workspace?’. This was going to be a fundamental part of Accurx's offering, so to ensure we were all moving towards the same goal, I worked with stakeholders to build a clearer picture to share across teams.

                <p>After aligning on the vision, I worked on the practical design pieces needed. For example, allowing users to create workspaces, add people to them and self-manage them through different roles and permissions.</p>
                <p>I continuously worked with user reseachers, developers, product and other stakeholders to add each piece.</p>
